Create a one-page JavaScript application that will be included in your final project. It does not matter what the project is. I would suggest building something simple that is useful. I have included some idea links below. I will be scanning the code for plagiarism. Be careful taking code that you find online as that will result in a zero. Please add comments to your code in the backend that explains what each function and variable is used for. I will be looking for them when grading. Please use the actual link to submit that will be used in your final project.
