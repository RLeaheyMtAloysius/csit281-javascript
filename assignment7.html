In the video this week, I walked through the process of creating an accordion to use on your final project portfolio website. Create your own version of the accordion and make sure to style it differently than the one I created. Make sure the styles work with the theme you chose. You can use it for any section of your site. I would suggest using real content so you can begin organizing your content now. I added the topic ideas list to the notes for this week. Submit the link to your live webpage that uses the accordion.Â
